# Play it yourself

...is an interactive audio installation making use of the Yamaha Disklavier, created by Mattias HÃ¥llsten and premiered in 2018 at the Royal College of Music.

## About

1709 is considered to be the year for the invention of the _piano forte_, the predecessor to the modern piano. Throughout the industrial revolution it developed into what is generally referred to as a modern upright piano. Being an expensive instrument, the modern piano became a symbol of wealth and social status among the middle class in Europe during the 19th century.

In bourgois households, it was more common for the daughters than the sons of a family to learn the instrument, but women were generally discouraged from pursuing a professional career as a musician. Rather, the purpouse for families to have a piano-playing daughter was for the family a source of entertaiment and for the daughter a source of leisure. Moreover, the ability to play the piano seemed to increase a woman's marriageability. Although pianists in middle class households did usually not go on to become professional pianists, they often kept track of techically challenging works by contemporary composers, and one especially popular form of musical recreation was the four-hand piano, where two people sat next to eachother and played the piano collaboratively.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the _player piano_ was rising in popularity. Instead of a person playing the instrument, now one could load punch cards into the instrument, similar to the mechanics of a music box. Having a daughter in the household playing the piano was now not a requirement for music to be heard -- instead, composers could distribute their music as player piano punch cards. The music no longer required a human interpreter and was now fixed, stripped of the explorative and child-like qualities of a human interpreter. 

In 1987, Yamaha introduced their newest development in player piano technology, the _Disklavier_. The Disklavier was a major leap in the development of the player piano, with the introduction of floppy disks, rather than punch cards, holding the recordings. The distribution of popular music was now greatly simplified, and today an Ebay search for "Disklavier" leads to floppy disks containing classics by The Beatles, Elton John and the likes. 

Today, modern [Disklaviers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8La94sbUC0) and equivalent instruments by [Steinway & Sons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_XPRAiy9Y4) are controlled via apps of mobile phones, and users can interact with the instruments' vast musical libraries much like one would interact with a music player like Spotify or iTunes. The user can make playlists, connect radio stations, and keep the instrument playing for long durations of time as a constant source of entertainment. The bourgois dream of a piano-containing household has now, in a sense, reached its peak with the increasing fidelity of piano recordings being played back by player pianos. But still, as with the original player piano, the interpretation of the musical material is fixed.

Growing up in a middle class suburban community, I saw a piano in almost every household. The piano served as both a source of leisurly musical inspriation for me and my friends, as well as being almost a requirement for a middle class family living in a villa. 

The playfullness that the piano yielded as a given object in every household, combined with the instrument being one of the pinnacles in terms of music played by amateurs (again, piano-playing daughters were not encouraged to persue a professional career) has been the central source of inspiration for this installation. The music is here played by an algorithm rather then written beforehand, and controlled by the visitor. The visitor then takes on the role of both performer/listener, finding a middle-ground between the fixed nature of a player piano and the playful and child-like nature of a regular upright piano.

The visitor can, rather than only hearing their favourite piece of music, _interact_ with the piano, much like a child in a middle class household would. The installation also mimics and expands upon the four-hand piano form, where two players sit next to eachother performing a piece of music together -- in _Play it Yourself_, the details of the piano-playing algorithm are further discovered as more people collaborate on the performing and listening of the material.

## Techicalities

Technically, _Play it Yourself_ is a `node.js` app for sending OSC messages to a [Pd-patch](https://github.com/mattiashallsten/playityourself-sequencer), in turn sending MIDI to a Yamaha Disklavier.

### Requirements

- Node.js version 9.11.1

### Installation

To install node.js using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), type:
```
$ brew install node
```

To install the dependencies, navigate to the downloaded repository and type:

```
npm install
```

### Instructions

In your terminal, go to the directory where this project is. Then, write:

```
$ node app.js
```

You will then be asked what ip address and what port number the OSC messages should be sent to. If running the node.js server and PD patch on the same machine, use the default values (IP: 127.0.0.1, port: 8000). If running the PD patch on a separate machine, make sure that the two machines are on the same network and type in the ip address of the machine running the PD patch.

The node server then serves on port 4200. The port number can be changed on line 386 in the app.js file:

```
server.listen(4200)
```




## TODO

- Fix bug: sometimes the array containing the IP's of connected clients exceeds the size of three, and adds a fourth element containing `undefined: null`.
